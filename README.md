# Ano-Note - Note taking app
This is a note-taking app developed primarily from the point of view of Front-End Web developement.
It doesn't have storage facility, so everytime, it starts with a blank slate.
But that will change when I learn backend stuff as well.
Then the notes will be stored on a database and pulled as needed from it.

# features: as of now
* displays 9 latest notes you have created, more recent ones first.
* placeholder text for empty notes list
* form to add a note

# features: planned
* click to make a particular note bigger.
* option to delete a note.
* backend support to save notes in a database.
